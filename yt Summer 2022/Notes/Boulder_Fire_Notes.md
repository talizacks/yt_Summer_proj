# **Boulder Fire Notes**
#Boulder
## Learned:
* About Data Format (GRIB2):
	* Messy but very cool
	* Everything is extremely 

* Model Outputs refer to full continent
* Reflectivity files are just boulder fire
*  level = height
*  Using xarray to give me names of variables for each layerType to create linked dropdown menus (i.e. variable options change depending on chosen layerType)
